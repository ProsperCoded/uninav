## **Overview**

**UniNav** is a collaborative **university study materials platform** that allows students to **upload, share, and access essential course-related resources** organized by faculty and department. It simplifies academic material discovery, enhances collaboration, and enables students to contribute to a growing knowledge base.

Unlike traditional resource-sharing methods, **UniNav integrates a structured storage system, real-time updates, and monetization opportunities** , ensuring a seamless user experience.

Students are not just consumers but active contributors, uploading study materials. This fosters a community-driven approach where current and past students can help each other by making valuable resources available to everyone in their department or course.

By leveraging these shared materials and integrating a recommendation algorithm, the platform provides personalized suggestions based on a userâ€™s academic profile, interests, and the materials explored by students in similar courses. This ensures that new students, or those transitioning to new levels, can quickly familiarize themselves with the required study materials, eliminating the hassle of searching for resources during the critical first weeks of the semester.
